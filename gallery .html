    <h3>Hello everyone! My name is Aman and I am currently a student of school class 9, with a heightened passion for football and an ambition of making a career out of it. Although, I have a good academic record to back me up in case things do not work out in the way I plan them. I am a regular in my school's football team and have been quite successful at it. I have participated in quite a few inter-school competitions and tournaments and have actually been able to excel in it at times. Despite my fairly young age, I have adopted a very mature approach when it comes to football and try to work seriously on it. My aim is to make football as a career, since I love it that much, and I am willing to put in the hard work to make sure that I can fulfil my dream.</h3>
   <br>
    <h3>My goal is to become a successful professional in my field. Despite the difficulties, I will try my best to pursue it. To achieve this, I need to set targets that are achievable and realistic. I will also need to evaluate and track my progress, as well as assess what areas I need to improve on. I will draw up strategies and plans that map out how I can get to where I want to be. I will also dedicate my time to learning and improving my skills, as well as equip myself with the right resources that I require for success. Additionally, I will not give up even when things get tough. I must persist and push forward. By staying disciplined, focused and determined, I will be able to stay on track in reaching my goal.</h3>
